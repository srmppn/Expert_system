# Expert_system
- expert system or rule-based system or knowledge-based system or what ever they're called using python
# Update
- Now it can save/edit/delete/check the rule, so you don't have to type the rule everytime you want to use.
# How to use
- first step enter the number of rules that you're going to use.
- then enter each rule, based on this form -> if [premise] then [conclusion], for example "if a then b" or "if bork then dog"
- once you've done all of that, it's going to diagnosing phase which will ask the user about the truth of each node.
- after that the result will show up if it exists.
# Warning
- I wrote this code by my own so it has a lot of bug in there due to my dumb
